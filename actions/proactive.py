    """
    Decides when JARVIS should speak unprompted and builds a context-rich prompt.

    Improvements over 1.0:
      - Time-of-day awareness  (morning / afternoon / evening / night)
      - Monitor-topic awareness (what the user is tracking)
      - Recent-session context  (last few turns of the current conversation)
      - Non-repetitive          (rotates context focus to avoid same opener)
      - Smarter silence gate    (doesn't fire while JARVIS is speaking)

    Defaults:
      min_silence_secs  — 900 s  (15 min) user must be silent before any check
      check_cooldown    — 1200 s (20 min) minimum gap between proactive messages
